# Pre-work - *CalculateMyTip*

**CalculateMyTip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Guanting Li**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Implemented Settings Menu, to change 3 values of tip size
* [x] Used UserDefaults to persistently store tip percentage size across all app usages
* [x] Read documentation to learn synchronize() is deprecated, action is now done on default
* [x] Improved UI through rearrangement and clarification

## Notes

Understanding the Settings page requirements, how to get there through my own googling, and building out the features without explicit guidance was definitely a great learning experience. I benefitted a lot from getting limited scaffolding guidance, and then gaining confidence in my own abilities as a developer by completing the tasks through my own explorations.
